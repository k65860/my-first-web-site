    <p><strong>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/)</strong>, often abbreviated as JS, is a <u>programming language</u> that is one of the core
        technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the
        client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
        dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It
        has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
        Object Model (DOM).</p>
