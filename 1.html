    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or <Strong>HTML</Strong> is the <u>standard markup language</u> for documents
        designed
        to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
        scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 40px"> browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
        documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
        included
        cues for its appearance.

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by
        denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
        elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly
        introduce
        content into the page. Other tags such as
    <p> and </p> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not
    display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
